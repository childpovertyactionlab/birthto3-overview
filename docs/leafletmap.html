<p>The toggles on the top right of the map have grouped all census tracts based on how the median income in a census tract differs from the mean income in Dallas County. I.E.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Very Below:</strong> Contains all tracts greater than 1 standard deviation below the mean.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>somewhat Below:</strong> Contains all tracts between -1 and -0.25 standard deviations below the mean.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>About Average:</strong> Contains all tracts between -0.25 and 0.25 standard deviations from the mean.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Somewhat Above:</strong> Contains all tracts between 0.25 and 1 standard deviations above the mean.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Very Above:</strong> Contains all tracts greater than 1 standard deviation above the mean.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The intention behind the toggles is to visually identify neighborhoods which may have similar demographic and racial/ethnic makeups for on the ground exploration.</p>
<p>The toggles can be generated based on other variables such as Child Poverty Rate upon request if a different view is wanted.</p>
<p>Clicking/Hovering on an individual tract will lower the opacity allowing you to view the streets an intersections of the tract as well as providing a small popup containing some basic information about the census tract including demographic, and economic data.</p>

<p>The table below contains a subsection of data pulled for this data request allowing a quick visual reference for some key data of interest. Table can be sorted in ascending or descending order based on any variable using the arrows. If you would like to filter the table based on a subset of any values click on the box below the variable name and a range bar will appear allowing you to make those selections.</p>
